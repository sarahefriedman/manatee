# Funderwooding Central

## Hi Hector! This can be a great space for us to Funderwood Git... if that's a thing.

If you have time, could you make edits to this file and then submit a pull request, and then I could practice pulling/merging? Not like you aren't crazy busy or anything.... :)

... seriously, no worries if you don't have time.

* Also
* I can do this thing in MD
* Where I make a list of items
* Extremely high-tech

### This is fun. I totally have time
* I agree
* This is totall high-tech
* [You can totally add Links too!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
