# life update
So after all the agonizing in that data science class I'm taking
we come to a lesson that solves all of my problem.
A package called "dplyr" that is the most convenient thing
I have ever seen.
Simple grammar, intuitive, and geared towards what people
actually need to see from data.

# rant time
SO WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING ALL THIS WHILE

# continuing rant
WHY EVEN BOTHER TO LEARN OTHER STUFF IN R IF DPLYR EXISTS

# end of rant
That is all. And I wanted to send it in git to ensure I
still remember how. :)
